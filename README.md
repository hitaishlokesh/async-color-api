  Problem Description :
  
  Word Input 
  
    ● An input field where users can type in any word and get results 
  
  
  Related Color List 
  
    ● Once the user enters the input word, the related colors to that word must be listed
      out in the form of a masonry grid of color cards. 
    ● Each color card should have the hex value of the color and a background of that respective color. 
    ● You can use any open source data set to derive the colors but it must be related to that word 
    ● The data set relation must be documented in the readme.md of this project.
    ● For ex., you can get the google image search result of that word, find the dominant color of
      each image and display them as related color lists. 
    
    
This is how it looks like :
