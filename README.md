  Problem Description :
  
  Word Input 
  
    ● An input field where users can type in any word and get results 
  
  
  Related Color List 
  
    ● Once the user enters the input word, the related colors to that word must be listed
      out in the form of a masonry grid of color cards. 
    ● Each color card should have the hex value of the color and a background of that respective color. 
    ● You can use any open source data set to derive the colors but it must be related to that word 
    ● The data set relation must be documented in the readme.md of this project.
    ● For ex., you can get the google image search result of that word, find the dominant color of
      each image and display them as related color lists.
